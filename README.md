Repository for the creation of a professional website done through Duke University Union Technology for Freewater Productions.

Freewater Productions is Duke University’s foremost and only student-run production company, operating under the umbrella of Duke’s student union, the Duke University Union (DUU). 


## Project Structure

- **HTML Pages**: The website consists of multiple HTML pages located in the root directory or in the `pages` folder.
  
     Key Items:
        **Home**: The homepage of the website. Found at `home.html`.
        **Projects**: A page showcasing various projects. Found at `pages/projects.html`.
        **Make a Film**: A page providing information on how to make a film. Found at `pages/make-a-film.html`.
        **Glossary**: A glossary page for terms related to the site. Found at `pages/glossary.html`.
        **Contact**: A page with contact information. Found at `pages/contact-us.html`.


- **Stylesheets**: CSS stylesheets are organized in the `layout/styles` folder. This includes layout.css (general styling), custom.flexslider.css (Flexslider styling), and horizontal/vertical timeline stylesheets.
- **Images**: PNGs and other images are stored in the `images/graphics` folder.


## Running the Website

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Open the project directory**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Open the HTML files**: Use a code editor to open the HTML files you want to work on.

4. **Install Live Server extension**: If you haven't already, install the Live Server extension for your code editor.

5. **Launch Live Server**: Open any HTML file and click the "Go Live" button in your code editor (or follow the extension's instructions). This will automatically launch a live server and open the file in your default browser.

6. **View your changes**: As you make changes to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, Live Server will automatically refresh the browser to display your updates in real time.


## Editing and Updating

Here's how you can make edits and updates to the website:

- **HTML Pages**: To modify the content of a page, open the corresponding HTML file and make your changes directly. Each film has its own page in the `pages` folder.
  
- **Styles**: To change styles, fonts, or colors, edit the appropriate stylesheet in the `layout/styles` folder. For example, `layout.css` controls overall style, `custom.flexslider.css` controls Flexslider framework styles, and `horizontaltl.css` and `verticaltl.css` control timeline styles.

- **Images**: Add new images or update existing ones by placing them in the `images/graphics` folder. Ensure your images are appropriately named and formatted.

- **Tabs and Footer**: The tabs and footer content are consistent across all HTML pages. Make changes to these sections in the relevant HTML files to apply updates site-wide.
